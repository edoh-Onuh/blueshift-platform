## When You Feel Overwhelmed

**Remember:** Quality > Quantity

It's better to:
- Have 1 excellent README than 10 mediocre docs

- Submit a polished application late than a rushed one early
- Show 1 working demo than promise 10 features

**You have 22 days. Use them wisely.**

Start with Day 1 tasks right now. 🚀
